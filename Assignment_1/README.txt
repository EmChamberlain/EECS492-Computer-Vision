This project asks you to implement solving geometric analogy problems.

Before you get started, you should install the OpenCV, a computer vision library. We will use this to display the diagrams for submission, and also for your own benefit. If installed successfully, you should be able to run the given code without modifications and see a visualization of the input diagrams.

You are tasked with outputting the shapes that are present in each diagram (see handout for examples.) The provided code has functionality for loading in the representations, displaying them, and outputting the result to file. Additionally, there are some helper functions to help you.
